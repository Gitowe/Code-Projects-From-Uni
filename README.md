# Code-Projects-From-Uni

Repository to hold all the more interesting coding projects I did at my university.

The majority of the code should be C/C++, with most of them being algorithms or demonstrations of codign concepts.
To run them, use the makefile provided in each folder. Some are currently missing but they will be added eventually.
