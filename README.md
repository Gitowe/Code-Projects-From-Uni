# Code-Projects-From-Uni

Repository to hold all the more interesting coding projects I did at my university.

The majority of the code should be C/C++, with most of them being algorithms or demonstrations of codign concepts.
To run them, use the makefile provided in each folder. Some are currently missing but they will be added eventually.

Will be updated with more code once I've made sure they are soley made by me, at some point some assembly will be provided.
